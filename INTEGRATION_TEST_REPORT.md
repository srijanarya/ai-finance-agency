4. **Content Pipeline**: Generation → Intelligence analysis → Delivery
5. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time market data and notifications
6. **Message Queue Integration**: RabbitMQ routing and processing

## Recommendations

### 🎯 Immediate Actions
1. **Start Microservices**: Deploy remaining 10 microservices
   ```bash
   docker-compose --profile microservices up -d
   ```

2. **Stabilize Infrastructure**: Wait for Redis and RabbitMQ to complete restart
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart redis rabbitmq
   ```

3. **Build Missing Images**: Some services may need image building
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
1. **Health Check Endpoints**: Standardize /health responses across services
2. **Service Dependencies**: Improve startup order and dependency management
3. **Error Handling**: Implement circuit breakers for service resilience
4. **Monitoring**: Add Prometheus metrics collection

### 📊 Testing Expansion
1. **Load Testing**: Test concurrent user scenarios
2. **Security Testing**: API authentication and authorization
3. **Data Flow Testing**: End-to-end transaction scenarios
4. **Performance Testing**: Response time and throughput benchmarks
