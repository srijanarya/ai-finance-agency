# Story: Dependencies Management
**ID:** DEPS-002  
**Sprint:** 1  
**Points:** 3  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Status:** Ready for Development

## User Story
**As a** developer  
**I want to** manage all project dependencies efficiently  
**So that** the system has all required libraries for AI, database, web functionality, and testing

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Comprehensive Requirements File
**Given** the project needs multiple Python packages  
**When** I create requirements files  
**Then** all dependencies should be organized by category with version pinning

### AC2: Virtual Environment Setup
**Given** the need for isolated dependency management  
**When** I set up the development environment  
**Then** a virtual environment should be configured with all packages installed

### AC3: Version Compatibility
**Given** multiple packages with potential conflicts  
**When** dependencies are installed  
**Then** all packages should be compatible with Python 3.11+ and each other

### AC4: Security Scanning
**Given** the need for secure dependencies  
**When** packages are installed  
**Then** a security scan should identify any known vulnerabilities

### AC5: Installation Documentation
**Given** new developers joining the project  
**When** they need to set up their environment  
**Then** clear installation instructions should be available

### AC6: Dependency Updates
**Given** the need for maintaining dependencies  
**When** updates are available  
**Then** there should be a process for safe dependency updates

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Requirements Files Structure
Create multiple requirements files:
- `requirements/base.txt` - Core dependencies
- `requirements/dev.txt` - Development tools
- `requirements/test.txt` - Testing frameworks
- `requirements/prod.txt` - Production optimizations
- `requirements.txt` - Main file that includes base

### 2. Core Dependencies Categories

**AI/ML Libraries:**
```txt
anthropic==0.18.1
openai==1.12.0
langchain==0.1.7
transformers==4.36.0
```

**Database & Storage:**
```txt
supabase==2.3.4
redis==5.0.1
sqlalchemy==2.0.25
alembic==1.13.1
```

**Web Framework:**
```txt
fastapi==0.109.0
flask==3.0.0
flask-cors==4.0.0
uvicorn==0.27.0
```

**API Integrations:**
```txt
tweepy==4.14.0
python-telegram-bot==20.7
yfinance==0.2.33
requests==2.31.0
```

**Data Processing:**
```txt
pandas==2.1.4
numpy==1.26.3
scipy==1.11.4
scikit-learn==1.3.2
```

### 3. Development Dependencies
```txt
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-cov==4.1.0
pytest-asyncio==0.21.1
black==23.12.0
flake8==6.1.0
mypy==1.7.1
pre-commit==3.6.0
```

### 4. Virtual Environment Setup Script
Create `setup_env.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Dependency Management Tools
- Use `pip-tools` for dependency resolution
- Implement `dependabot` for automated updates
- Add `safety` for security scanning

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Requirements Structure
- [ ] Create requirements directory
- [ ] Split dependencies into categorized files
- [ ] Add version pinning for all packages
- [ ] Create main requirements.txt with includes

### Task 2: Virtual Environment Setup
- [ ] Create setup script for Unix/Mac
- [ ] Create setup script for Windows
- [ ] Add .gitignore entries for venv
- [ ] Document activation commands

### Task 3: Dependency Installation & Testing
- [ ] Test installation on clean system
- [ ] Verify all imports work
- [ ] Check for version conflicts
- [ ] Measure installation time

### Task 4: Security & Compatibility
- [ ] Run safety check for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test Python 3.11 compatibility
- [ ] Document any OS-specific requirements
- [ ] Create compatibility matrix

### Task 5: Documentation
- [ ] Create INSTALL.md guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Document update procedures
- [ ] Add dependency graph visualization

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All requirements files created and organized
- [ ] Virtual environment setup scripts working
- [ ] All packages install without conflicts
- [ ] Security scan shows no high vulnerabilities
- [ ] Installation tested on Mac/Linux/Windows
- [ ] Documentation complete with troubleshooting
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline updated with new dependencies
- [ ] Package licenses reviewed for compatibility

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Clean Installation
```bash
# Remove existing environment
rm -rf venv
# Run setup script
./setup_env.sh
# Verify all packages installed
pip list
```

### Test 2: Import Verification
```python
# Test all major imports
import anthropic
import openai
import fastapi
import pandas
import redis
# All should import without errors
```

### Test 3: Security Scan
```bash
safety check
# Should show no high severity vulnerabilities
```

### Test 4: Compatibility Test
```bash
pip check
# Should show no incompatible packages
```

## Notes for AI Developer

**File Locations:**
- Requirements files: `/requirements/`
- Setup scripts: `/scripts/`
- Documentation: `/docs/INSTALL.md`

**Existing Dependencies:**
Check current `requirements.txt` and `requirements_v2.txt` files to incorporate existing dependencies.

**Version Strategy:**
- Pin major and minor versions (e.g., `==1.2.x`)
- Allow patch updates for security fixes
- Test thoroughly before major version updates

**Common Issues:**
- Some packages may need system libraries (document these)
- Windows may need Visual C++ for some packages
- M1 Macs may need special handling for some packages
