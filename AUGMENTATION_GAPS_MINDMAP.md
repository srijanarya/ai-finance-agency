## 🚨 DECISION FRAMEWORK

```
If Finance Content Validates (>80% interest):
    → Full commitment to finance vertical
    → Build compliance moat immediately
    → Expand to adjacent financial services

If Finance Partially Validates (50-80%):
    → Pivot to specific sub-niche (e.g., mutual funds only)
    → Test adjacent vertical simultaneously

If Finance Fails (<50%):
    → Immediate pivot to Legal (second highest score)
    → Leverage augmentation thesis in new vertical
```

**Bottom Line**: Your finance expertise + augmentation thesis + compliance moat = highest probability of monopoly success.
