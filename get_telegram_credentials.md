# 📱 How to Get Your Telegram API Credentials

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: We need API_ID and API_HASH, not RSA keys!

### What you provided:
- ✅ RSA Public Keys (server configuration)
- ❌ API ID (needed)
- ❌ API Hash (needed)

## 🔧 Steps to Get API Credentials:

1. **Go to**: https://my.telegram.org/
2. **Login** with your phone number
3. **Click** "API development tools"
4. **Look for**:
   ```
   App api_id: [NUMBERS HERE] ← Copy this
   App api_hash: [LONG STRING HERE] ← Copy this
   ```

## 📝 Example of what you should see:

```
Your Telegram Application

App api_id: 12345678
App api_hash: abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890

App title: AI Finance Bot
Short name: aifinancebot
```

## 🚫 What NOT to copy:
- RSA Public Keys (you already sent these)
- Server addresses (149.154.167.50:443)
- DC numbers

## ✅ Once you have them:

Update the .env file:
```
TELEGRAM_API_ID=12345678
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
TELEGRAM_PHONE=+919876543210
```

Then run:
```bash
python3 telegram_power_bot.py
```

**The RSA keys you sent are just server configs, we need the actual API credentials from the website!**
