Last time this happened? 21 years ago. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Unexpected connection? Gold. When the dollar flexes, gold usually shrinks. But this time, they're both mooning. \ud83d\ude80 Something's gotta give, right?\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Next, brace for volatility. Buckle up for some wild swings in the $DXY over the next few weeks. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Tomorrow's action? Keep a hawk eye on the Fed's tone. If they hint at higher interest rates, the dollar could explode... while crushing equities. \ud83e\udde8 \n\nMoney shot: If you'd scooped up $UUP (the dollar index ETF) instead of $GME at the start of 2021, you'd be up 18.7% more. That's not a typo. \ud83e\udd2f \n\nWho else is seeing this pattern? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nP.S. - The rally everyone's expecting? It's the trap. Remember the Golden Rule - when there's blood in the streets, it's time to buy. But whose blood will it be? \ud83e\ude78\"",
