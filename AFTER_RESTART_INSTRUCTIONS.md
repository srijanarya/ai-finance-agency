# After Mac Restart - Quick Recovery Guide

## Step 1: Verify Docker Desktop Starts Clean
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker version

# If Docker doesn't auto-start:
open -a Docker
# Wait 30 seconds for initialization
```

## Step 2: Run B-MAD Deployment
```bash
# Execute the B-MAD deployment pipeline
./scripts/bmad-deployment.sh
```

## Step 3: If Docker Still Has Issues
```bash
# Run the recovery script we created
./fix-docker-startup.sh
```

## Step 4: Alternative Quick Start
```bash
# Use the quick-start script as backup
./quick-start.sh
```

## What Will Happen:
The B-MAD deployment will execute 4 phases automatically:
1. **Phase 1**: Start infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, MongoDB)
2. **Phase 2**: Deploy 10 microservices in dependency order
3. **Phase 3**: Setup frontend integration
4. **Phase 4**: Apply production hardening

## Monitoring:
```bash
# Watch deployment progress
./scripts/coordination-monitor.sh

# Check service health
docker ps
```

## Success Indicators:
- All containers running: ✅
- API Gateway responding at http://localhost:3000: ✅
- No "Cannot connect to Docker daemon" errors: ✅

## Current Status Before Restart:
- B-MAD method fully implemented ✅
- All epics and stories completed ✅
- Deployment scripts ready ✅
- Docker Desktop needs clean restart to function ⚠️
