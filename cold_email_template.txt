Hi [Name],

I noticed {company} is investing heavily in content marketing but missing out on regional languages where engagement is 60% higher.

We're India's first multilingual finance content engine, already generating content in 9 languages with:
• 5,658% efficiency gain through AI orchestration
• SEBI-compliant content generation
• Platform-specific optimization (LinkedIn, Instagram, WhatsApp)

For the first 3 enterprise clients, we're offering:
• 50 pieces of content monthly (Hindi + English + 1 regional)
• Just ₹1.5 lakhs/month (normally ₹2.5L)
• 7-day free trial

Here's a sample piece we created: [Attach sample]

Can we discuss how to 10x your content reach this week?

Best regards,

P.S. Zerodha credits 80% of their 1.3 crore users to content marketing. Regional content is the next frontier.
