# CRITICAL PROJECT CONTEXT - DO NOT IGNORE

## ACTUAL SITUATION
- **Budget**: ₹1 lakh ONLY (user has loans running)
- **Goal**: Reach ₹1 crore revenue FASTEST way possible

### 4. 50+ Python Scripts

## WHAT NOT TO DO
❌ NO over-engineering microservices

❌ NO long development cycles
❌ NO demos - use REAL systems

## REVENUE PRIORITY (WEEK 1)
1. Package content generation system → ₹50,000 MRR
2. Launch education funnel → ₹2,50,000 immediate
3. Deploy scanner/tools as lead magnets
4. Activate lead generation for B2B sales

## COMMUNICATION RULES
1. When finding existing assets, IMMEDIATELY document them here
2. Share this file with PM/BA before any planning
3. Every suggestion must reference existing working code
4. Budget reality check: We have ₹1 lakh, not ₹20-30 Cr

## GitHub Projects to Integrate
User has additional repositories with:
- More trading tools
- Scanner systems  
- Lead capture mechanisms
- Ask user to share these links

## SUCCESS METRICS
