# Feature Specification: Photo Album Organizer

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extract: photo organization, albums, date grouping, drag-drop, tile preview
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: users
   ’ Actions: organize photos, create albums, drag-drop reorder, view photos
   ’ Data: photos, albums, dates, metadata
   ’ Constraints: no nested albums, date-based grouping
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: photo source - local files or cloud storage?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: supported image formats?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum album/photo limits?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flows identified for album management and photo viewing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Photos, Albums, metadata relationships defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding photo source and formats"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user with a collection of digital photos, I want to organize my photos into albums that are automatically grouped by date, so I can easily find and view photos from specific time periods. I also want to manually reorganize these albums on the main page to prioritize certain collections.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has photos on their device, **When** they open the application, **Then** photos are automatically organized into albums based on their date metadata
2. **Given** albums are displayed on the main page, **When** the user drags an album to a new position, **Then** the album order is updated and persisted
3. **Given** a user clicks on an album, **When** the album opens, **Then** all photos within are displayed in a tile/grid layout
4. **Given** photos are displayed in tile view, **When** a user clicks on a photo, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: full-screen view, editing options, or metadata display?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when photos have no date metadata? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: fallback sorting method?]
- How does system handle very large albums (1000+ photos)?
- What occurs when dragging an album to an invalid position?
- How are duplicate photos handled within or across albums?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically group photos into albums based on date metadata
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all albums on a main page interface
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to reorder albums via drag and drop functionality
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist album order changes between sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce that albums cannot be nested within other albums
- **FR-006**: System MUST display photos within albums in a tile/grid preview interface
- **FR-007**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which image formats - JPEG, PNG, GIF, RAW?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle photo collections from [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: local storage, cloud services, or both?]
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to view individual photos from the tile interface
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain photo quality and metadata during organization

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Photo**: Individual image file with associated metadata (date taken, size, format, location)
- **Album**: Collection of photos grouped by date range, with display order and title
- **Album Order**: Persisted arrangement of albums on the main page
- **Photo Metadata**: Date/time taken, file size, dimensions, format, optional location data
