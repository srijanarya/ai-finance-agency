# Implementation Plan: Photo Album Organizer

**Branch**: `001-build-an-application` | **Date**: 2025-09-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context
   → Project Type: web (frontend with local storage)
   → Structure Decision: Option 2 (Web application)
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Simplicity: PASS (1 project, minimal libs, single data model)
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Clarifications resolved for local-only operation
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → All checks pass
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Task generation approach defined
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build a photo organization application that automatically groups photos into date-based albums with drag-and-drop reordering. Implementation uses Vite with vanilla JavaScript and SQLite for local metadata storage, ensuring minimal dependencies and offline-first operation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES6+, HTML5, CSS3  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite (build tool), better-sqlite3 (local database)  
**Storage**: SQLite for metadata, File System API for photo references  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)  
**Project Type**: web - frontend with local backend  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms album load time, smooth drag animations at 60fps  
**Constraints**: No server uploads, all data stored locally, <10MB initial bundle  
**Scale/Scope**: Support 10,000+ photos, 100+ albums

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (web app with local storage)
- Using framework directly? Yes (vanilla JS, no wrappers)
- Single data model? Yes (unified photo/album model)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct SQLite access, no ORM)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes (photo-manager, album-organizer, drag-handler)
- Libraries listed:
  - photo-manager: Handle photo metadata extraction
  - album-organizer: Date-based grouping logic
  - drag-handler: Drag-drop functionality
  - db-manager: SQLite operations
- CLI per library: Each has test runner
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (actual SQLite, real files)
- Integration tests for: All library boundaries
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test enforced

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (console with levels)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (local only)
- Error context sufficient? Yes (file paths, error codes)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A (first version)

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application with local database

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
