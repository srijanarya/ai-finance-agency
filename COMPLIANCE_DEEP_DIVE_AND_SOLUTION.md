# COMPLIANCE DEEP DIVE: What It Is & Why It's a ‚Çπ100 Cr Problem

## üö® WHAT IS COMPLIANCE CHECKING IN FINANCE CONTENT?

### The Problem in Simple Terms:
When you create finance content in India, you can accidentally:
1. **Give illegal investment advice** (without SEBI RIA license)
2. **Manipulate stock prices** (pump and dump allegations)
3. **Mislead investors** (criminal liability)
4. **Violate disclosure rules** (heavy fines)

### Real Examples of Violations:

**‚ùå ILLEGAL (Without License):**
```
"Buy Reliance at ‚Çπ2,400, target ‚Çπ2,800"
"This mutual fund will give 15% returns"
"Shift your portfolio to IT stocks now"
"This is the best time to invest in gold"
```

**‚úÖ LEGAL (Educational):**
```
"Reliance has grown 20% in last year"
"Mutual funds have historically given 12% returns"
"IT sector contributes 8% to GDP"
"Gold is considered a hedge against inflation"
```

The difference is subtle but legally critical!
