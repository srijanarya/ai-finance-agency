Its stock has risen from \u20b9950 to \u20b91,200 this year, reflecting growing investor confidence in the sector. This growth aligns with India's ambitious goal of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. \ud83c\udf31\n\nHowever, I believe we should shift our focus to mid-cap companies. While industry giants like Adani often dominate headlines, nimble mid-cap players are poised for significant growth as government policies increasingly support the renewable energy transition.\n\nExploring these hidden gems\u2014companies with strong fundamentals that remain under the radar\u2014could enhance your portfolio and lead to higher returns. \ud83d\udcc8 \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **What are your thoughts?
