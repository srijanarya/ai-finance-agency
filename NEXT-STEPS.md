# üöÄ AI Finance Agency - Next Steps & Action Items

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Infrastructure & Services
- ‚úÖ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors (38 errors resolved)
- ‚úÖ Payment Service running successfully on port 3001
- ‚úÖ All infrastructure services operational (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive startup script (`scripts/start-all-services.sh`)
- ‚úÖ LinkedIn refresh token added to environment configuration

## üî¥ Critical Issues to Address

### 1. LinkedIn API Authentication (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Access tokens are revoked/insufficient permissions
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Re-authenticate LinkedIn Company account with proper scopes:
  - `r_organization_social` - Read organization updates
  - `w_organization_social` - Post on behalf of organization
  - `rw_organization_admin` - Manage organization
- [ ] Re-authenticate LinkedIn Personal account with scopes:
  - `r_liteprofile` - Read basic profile
  - `r_emailaddress` - Read email address
  - `w_member_social` - Share content

**How to fix**:
1. Visit: https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps
2. Update OAuth 2.0 scopes for both apps
3. Generate new authorization URL with required scopes
4. Complete OAuth flow to get new access/refresh tokens

### 2. Service Port Conflicts
**Issue**: Multiple service instances trying to bind to same ports
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Kill all duplicate processes: `pkill -f "nest start"`
- [ ] Run the unified startup script: `./scripts/start-all-services.sh`
- [ ] Implement process management with PM2

## üìã Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Complete Service Deployment (Today)
```bash
# Clean up all existing services
pkill -f "nest start"

# Start all services properly
./scripts/start-all-services.sh

# Verify all services are running
curl http://localhost:3000/health  # API Gateway
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Payment
curl http://localhost:3002/health  # User Management
# ... etc for all services
```

### 2. Fix LinkedIn Integration (Today)
- Generate new OAuth tokens with proper permissions
- Update `.env` file with new tokens
- Test posting functionality
- Set up automated content scheduling

### 3. Configure Market Data Feeds (Tomorrow)
- [ ] Obtain production API keys for:
  - Alpha Vantage (currently using 'demo')
  - Finnhub (currently using 'demo')
  - Polygon.io (currently using 'demo')
- [ ] Update `.env` with real API keys
- [ ] Test real-time market data streaming
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connections

### 4. Set Up Production Monitoring (This Week)
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus & Grafana stack
- [ ] Configure alerts for service health
- [ ] Set up log aggregation with ELK stack
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger
