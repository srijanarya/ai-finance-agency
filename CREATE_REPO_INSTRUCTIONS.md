# üöÄ CREATE GITHUB REPO - MANUAL STEPS

Since the CLI authentication is having issues, here's the quickest way:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Click this link:** [Create New Repository](https://github.com/new)

2. **Fill in:**
   - Repository name: `ai-finance-agency`

   - Private or Public: Your choice
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"

3. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Run these:

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/srijanarya/ai-finance-agency.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for authentication:
- Username: `srijanarya`
- Password: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (not your password!)

## To Create a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "AI Finance Agency"
4. Select scopes: ‚úÖ repo (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)
