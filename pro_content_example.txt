❌ BAD POST (Current):
"Today, on Sep 07, 2025, consider a long-term investment strategy for Indian markets with 60% in index funds, 30% in blue-chip stocks like Infosys..."

✅ PRO VERSION 1 - Data-Driven Insight:
"📊 Infosys at ₹1,847 - Trading 18% below 52W high

Why I'm watching:
• Q2 results beat street estimates by 12%
• $2.3B deal pipeline visibility
• Trading at 22x PE vs sector avg 28x

Not a buy call - DYOR. What's your view on IT sector valuations?"

✅ PRO VERSION 2 - Educational with Hook:
"Lost ₹47,000 in my first options trade.

Here's what I learned:
1. Never risk more than 2% per trade
2. Implied volatility crushes dreams faster than expiry
3. Selling options > Buying options (86% win rate)

Which expensive lesson taught you the most?"

✅ PRO VERSION 3 - Market Psychology:
"Market at 24,734. Everyone's waiting for 25,000.

But here's what smart money is doing:
• FIIs sold ₹106 Cr yesterday
• DIIs absorbed ₹2,233 Cr
• Put writers active at 24,500

The crowd watches resistance. Pros accumulate at support."

✅ PRO VERSION 4 - Contrarian Take:
"Unpopular opinion: Nifty won't cross 25,000 this month.

Why?
• 17 failed attempts at this level since Aug
• RSI divergence on daily charts
• September historically weak (last 10yr avg: -2.3%)

Agree or disagree? Let's discuss 👇"

✅ PRO VERSION 5 - Personal Story:
"Sold my HDFC Bank at ₹1,420 in panic last March.
Today: ₹1,650

Lesson: Your portfolio's worst enemy isn't the market.
It's the person in the mirror during red days.
