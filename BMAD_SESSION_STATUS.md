## 🔄 Current Work In Progress

### Epic Sharding (Next Step)
Based on PRD functional requirements, creating these epics:

1. **Epic 001**: User Management & Authentication (Priority P0)
2. **Epic 002**: Content Intelligence Engine (Priority P0) 
3. **Epic 003**: Multi-Platform Publishing System (Priority P0)
4. **Epic 004**: Analytics & Performance Tracking (Priority P1)
5. **Epic 005**: Enterprise Workflow Management (Priority P1)
6. **Epic 006**: API & Integration Platform (Priority P2)

### Story Creation Status
- **Epic 001**: ⏳ Ready to create stories
- **Others**: ⏳ Pending epic completion

## 🎯 Next Actions for Any Session

### Immediate Next Steps (Pick up here)
1. **Complete Epic Sharding**:
   ```bash
   # Use PO agent to continue sharding
   @po Create detailed epics from the PRD
   ```

2. **Create Development Stories**:
   ```bash
   # Use SM agent to create stories
   @sm Create first sprint stories from Epic 001
   ```

3. **Begin Development Cycle**:
   ```bash
   # Use Dev agent to implement
   @dev Implement story 001.1 - Basic User Registration
   ```

### Available BMAD Commands
```bash
# Product Owner Commands
@po *shard-epics          # Shard PRD into epics
@po *validate             # Validate against requirements

# Scrum Master Commands  
@sm *create-story         # Create development story
@sm *estimate             # Estimate story points

# Development Commands
@dev *implement           # Implement current story
@dev *test               # Run tests and validation

# QA Commands
@qa *review              # Review completed work
@qa *risk                # Assess technical risks
```

## 🏗️ Technical Foundation Ready

### Current Architecture
- **Pattern**: Microservices with event-driven architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Next.js
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis + ClickHouse
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes + AWS/Docker

### Existing Codebase Analysis
**Current State**: 50+ Python scripts that need consolidation
**Key Systems to Migrate**:
- `content_quality_system.py` → Content Intelligence Service
- `unified_platform.py` → Microservices architecture  
- `automated_social_media_manager.py` → Publishing Service
- Multiple `.py` dashboards → React frontend

- **MVP Launch**: 3 months from start

## 🤝 Session Handoff Instructions

### For Continuing This Work
1. **Read the planning docs** in `docs/` to understand context
2. **Use BMAD agents** with `@agent-name` syntax  
3. **Follow BMAD methodology**: Planning → Epics → Stories → Implementation
4. **Update this file** with your progress

### For Quality Assurance
```bash
@qa *review docs/prd.md           # Review requirements
@qa *risk docs/architecture.md    # Assess technical risks
@qa *validate Epic001             # Validate against DoD
```

### For Implementation
```bash
@sm *create-story Epic001         # Create stories from epic
@dev *implement Story001.1        # Implement user registration
@qa *test Story001.1              # Quality validation
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Multi-Tenant Security**: Every feature must enforce organization-level data isolation
2. **Compliance First**: Financial content requires regulatory compliance (SEC, FINRA)
3. **Performance Targets**: <200ms API response, 99.99% uptime
4. **Migration Strategy**: Preserve existing functionality while modernizing architecture
