# Project Status Reporting Framework
## Automated Phase Completion Documentation

---

## 📋 OVERVIEW

This framework ensures comprehensive project status reports are automatically generated and stored at the completion of each project phase, sprint, or major milestone.

---

## 🎯 REPORTING TRIGGERS

### Automatic Report Generation Occurs When:
1. **Sprint Completion** - End of each 2-week sprint
2. **Phase Completion** - Major project phase finished
3. **Milestone Achievement** - Key targets reached
4. **Critical Decision Points** - Strategic pivots or changes
5. **Budget Checkpoints** - 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% budget utilization
6. **Team Request** - On-demand status reports
